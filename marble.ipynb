The overall tone is peaceful and timeless, with warm sunlight illuminating weathered stone structures and lush greenery. The courtyard is paved with irregularly shaped cobblestones, radiating outwards from a central stone fountain that features a bowl-shaped basin filled with water. Stone buildings, multi-storied and adorned with climbing vines, encircle the courtyard, creating a secluded atmosphere. Arched doorways and windows with light blue wooden shutters are set into the textured stone walls, suggesting residences or small shops. A prominent stone staircase ascends along one of the buildings, leading to upper levels, with potted plants placed on its steps and landings. Various potted plants, including small trees and flowering shrubs, are strategically positioned around the courtyard, adding touches of vibrant green against the earthy tones of the stone. A wooden bench or table is tucked into an alcove on the left, offering a place for rest. The stone structures appear well-maintained, with a patina that speaks to centuries of existence. The arrangement of the buildings creates winding pathways and shaded nooks within the courtyard. The fountain stands as the undisputed focal point, with cobblestones forming a circular pattern around its base. The staircase extends upwards from the right side of the courtyard, curving gently as it ascends.
